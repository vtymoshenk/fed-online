    <h1>Cat</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><em>This article is about the species commonly kept as a pet. For the cat family, see Felidae. For other uses,
            see Cat
            (disambiguation) and Cats (disambiguation).</em></p>
    <p>The <strong>cat (Felis catus)</strong> , also referred to as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> or <strong>house
            cat</strong>, is a
        small domesticated carnivorous
        mammal. It
        is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
        domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat,
        but it
        also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its
        ability to
        kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a
        strong,
        flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It
        is a
        social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</p>
    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was
        first used
        at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African
        language.[5] The
        Nubian word kaddîska (wildcat) and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.</p>
